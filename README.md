# My Resume AWS

The application is to test out the S3 bucket triggered by Lambda. I put my basic resume html in the S3 bucket so that the public user can access this static website. By using the CloudFront aws service, I can secure the url. The following image is the result.

Note that I haven't implemented the domain for my url with Amazon Route 53. You can buy the domain with your likes.
